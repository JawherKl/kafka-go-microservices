# Kafka Producers and Consumers with Golang

This project demonstrates how to build Kafka Producers and Consumers using the Go programming language (Golang). It leverages the [confluent-kafka-go](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-go) library to connect and interact with Kafka brokers.

## 1. Introduction

This project provides a simple example of how to create Kafka producers and consumers using Golang. Producers are responsible for sending data (messages) to Kafka topics, while consumers subscribe to Kafka topics to read and process messages. 

## 2. Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following:

- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) installed (version 1.16 or later)
- [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart) installed and running on your local machine or server
- A working knowledge of Kafka and Go
- Confluent's Kafka Go client library: [confluent-kafka-go](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-go)

## 3. Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kafka-go-producer-consumer.git
   cd kafka-go-producer-consumer
   ```
